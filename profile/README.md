DX@Scale is a collection of practices, open-source tools, frameworks, and practitioners built on our experience in delivering large and complex Salesforce programs. 
Utilizing our 'curated' practices, you can build a modular Salesforce Org that is reliable and easy to maintain.

### Why DX@Scale?

We have been early adopters of Salesforce DX and saw it as a massive step towards improving the developer/admin experience. The version control system was finally the source of truth, and we loved it.
We wanted to take it to the next level and apply Continuous Delivery principles to Salesforce. We have defined an approach and a set of practices, and we have developed a set of tools to support them.
We have open-sourced all of that. DX@Scale is now used on more than 150 Salesforce Production Orgs worldwide
